# Lancing Fives Caffe website
## I'm planning on building this project into a website which students at my school (Lancing) can use to order their food and other junk from out Caffe

## social goals
- to reduce the amount of students having to queue in caffe - thus freeing up their time
- for staff its going to be automisation of order-flow where they can recieve an order, making the process much easier and simplier

## general problems
- cant use online payments - to complicated and not safe [###001]

## solutions
- ###001 - create in store credit, pupils can deposit money at the caffe which will then be added to their account
    - this will also help them manage their spending
    - !withdraws could be made any time!
